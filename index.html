     			 <p> Taylor Alison Swift, born December 13, 1989, grew up in Pennsylvania. Named after singer James Taylor, she comes from a mixed Scottish, German, and English background. Her dad, Scott, worked in stocks, and her mom, Andrea, in marketing. She has a younger brother, Austin, who is an actor. Her grandma, an opera singer, inspired her.
							She spent her childhood on a Christmas tree farm and summers in New Jersey, singing acoustic songs. After attending a Montessori school and Wyndcroft School, she moved to Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. There, she joined a local high school and took part in theater. She also had acting and singing lessons in New York City. Artists like Shania Twain and Patsy Cline helped shape her love for country music.
							At 11 years old, Taylor tried to get into the music industry in Nashville, Tennessee. She sent karaoke covers to record labels but faced rejections. This made her focus more on songwriting. She learned to play the guitar at 12 and started working with talent manager Dan Dymtrow in 2003. After performing at an RCA Records event, her family moved to Nashville. Here, she went to Hendersonville High School and then graduated early from Aaron Academy. </p>
